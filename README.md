# CnhBot
A Discord moderation bot inspired by the Brazilian traffic infractions point system

Core idea: users have a certain amount of behaviour points and they can be deducted when the user misbehaves and autopunish when the situation gets too bad. Also, behaviour points deductions expire after a set amount of time (e.g. a year).

Key features:

- [ ] Slash commands UI
- [ ] Automatically apply punishments when certain thresholds are reached
- [ ] Delete or punish users by replying to the offending message so that they can know where they fucked up. (plus, optionally sending a justification to the user so they know what rule they broke)
- [ ] Special reaction to let users flag content for moderator verification in a semi-anonymous way.
- [ ] Time limited softbans. (e.g. soft ban a user for 6 months)

Additional features I might implement: (just so I have to use less bots in total)
- [ ] Role persist with configurable exceptions for new user rules
- [ ] Leveling system
- [ ] Ticket system
- [ ] Message history (helps mods see what the hell happened)
